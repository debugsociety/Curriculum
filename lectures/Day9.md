git add: 
		-Git will include the 'add'ed files into your next commit.

git commit:

		-If this message displayed: no changes added to commit
		-You must git add [the file] then commit 

git checkout -b:
		-Git checkout -b is when you want to create a new branch and switch to that branch.
		-For example, I want to create a new branch named hello, I'd write git checkout -b hello
		-Then it should tell you that you are on branch hello

git checkout [branch] : 
		-Git checkout means that you are switching branches. 
		-For example, I am on branch hello and now I want to switch to the master branch.

git remote:
		-Shows which nicknames of the remote repositories that you are connected to.
		-For example,

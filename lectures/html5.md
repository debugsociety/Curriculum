# HTML5
HTML is the language of the web. Our websites will be output using HTML.

HTML should be the easiest language you learn.

## Want to see what HTML looks like?
Using Google Chrome or Firefox, right click almost any website (even Facebook!) and press 'inspect element'. The code that you see in the large area is HTML.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html> 
```

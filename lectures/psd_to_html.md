# Day 3: Development Tasks Building a popular website

## Pair Programming PSD-to-HTML+CSS

### Pair programming

- Increase in quality
- Some increase in velocity
- Knowledge transfer of mentorship sorts
- Culturation amongst teams
- Team dynamics, developer relationships
- Talk through thought process

Pair programming will facilitate. Take turns "driving", one driver per task. 
It is not backseat driving. Driver says their thought process, pair programmer points out typos and answers questions, transfers knowledge. Does not say what to type. 

"Pair programming increases software quality without impacting time to deliver. 2 people working at a single computer will add as much functionality as two working separately except that it will be much higher in quality." 				- [extremeprogramming.org](extremeprogramming.org)

### In class:

We will be pair-programming a real layout from image format to HTML and CSS.
We will work off of a photo of a popular website
We will program directly in a text editor (Notepad++ or Sublimetext 2)
Layouts should look exactly like the real thing
Today, we will program the content-rich Craigslist landing page: [http://washingtondc.craigslist.org](http://washingtondc.craigslist.org)

### PSD to HTML/CSS

A client expects to see little to no difference between a picture of a layout and the implemented layout.

Examples: 

[Picture 1 - Before](../layout/files/mobilelayout.jpg) vs [Picture 1 - After](../layout/files/mobilelayout.jpg)

[Picture 2 - Before](../layout/files/Picture2 before.jpg) vs [Picture 2 - After](../layout/files/fullsize-content.jpg)

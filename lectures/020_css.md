# CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is used to style (align, color, spacing, size) your HTML pages. If HTML provides the structure and furniture for a house, CSS provides the paint, finishing, and alignment.

## What does it look like?
The syntax for CSS code is:
```
[what is being styled (AKA Selectors)] {
[style properties]
}
```
For example:
```
body {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  margin-top: 0px;
  margin-right: 0px;
  margin-bottom: 0px;
  margin-left: 0px;
}

div {
  border: 1px solid #000000;
}

.text-large {
  font-size: 2em;
}

#main {
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #000000;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

## CSS Selectors
CSS Selectors are used to choose which item the styling should apply to.

You can target what the styling applies to:
- by element
 - syntax: ```div { /* properties */ }```
- by ID
 - syntax: ```#name-of-id { /* properties */ }```
- by class
 - syntax: ```.name-of-class { /* properties */ }```
- by a combination of targets
 - syntax: ```div.name-of-class { /* properties */ }```
 - or: ```div#name-of-id { /* properties */ }```
 - etc
- and more

### Elements
Your styling can target HTML elements.

For example, do you want all tables to have a border? Simply target the HTML tag for tables.
```
table {
/* CSS border property goes here */
}
```
Do you want all divs to be a certain width? Again, simply target the HTML tag for tables.
```
div {
/* CSS width property goes here */
}
```
Think of all the HTML elements you've learned about, they can all be targeted by CSS:
- h1 or h2 or h3, etc
 - ``` h1 { /* properties */ } ```
- div
 - ``` div { /* properties */ } ```
- ul or ol
 - ``` ul { /* properties */ } ```
- li
 - ``` li { /* properties */ } ```
- table
 - ``` table { /* properties */ } ```
- a (links)
 - ``` a { /* properties */ } ```
- p (paragraphs)
 - ``` p { /* properties */ } ```
- img
 - ``` img { /* properties */ } ```
- header
 - ``` header { /* properties */ } ```
- and many more.

Hopefully it's becoming clear now - you can target HTML elements by name in CSS.

### IDs
Let's say that you want to style one specific table on a page differently than the rest. Targeting the 'table' element is not enough, because all tables will be targeted. This is where ID's come in.

You can give your HTML elements *unique* ID attributes, and target those in your CSS. *IDs must be unique - the same ID cannot be used more than once on a single page.*

To add an ID attribute to an HTML element, simply add ```id="unique-name"``` to the element.

For example, let's give one table the unique ID of 'primary-table':
```
<table id ="primary-table">
  <tr>
    <td>This is a table we want to target.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>This is a table we are not targeting.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
#### Targeting the ID attribute in CSS
To target an element with a specific ID, simply target a hashtag followed by the ID's name, as shown:
```
#name-of-ID {
[style properties]
}
```
For example, let's target the above table with the unique ID of 'primary-table':

```
table {
  border: 1px solid #000000;
}
#primary-table {
  border: 3px solid red;
}
```
- Targeting 'table' above makes all tables default to a 1px black border.
- Targeting ```#primary-table``` makes the element with ID of ```primary-table``` have a 3px red border.
*Although 'Part 1' of the CSS targets ALL tables, targeting an ID takes priority over targeting an element. Therefore, Part 2 takes precedence for the table with that ID.*

### Classes
Classes are just like IDs, with the following exceptions:

1. Classes *can and should* be reused on a single page
 - Unlike IDs, which can only be used once on a page
2. Classes are assigned to HTML Elements by assigning them a 'class' attribute
 - i.e. ```<table class="large-font">```
3. In CSS, classes are targeted with a dot followed by the class name
 - i.e. ```.class-name { /* properties */ }```
4. HTML Elements can be assigned multiple classes
 - Multiple classes are separated by spaces
 - i.e. ```<table class="class-1 class-2 yet-another-class">```

#### What should classes contain?
A 'good' class is:
- *Rule 1:* Designed for reusability
- *Rule 2:* Not overly restricted by its name

You will get better at identifying a reuseable class through experience.

Here are some examples of what I mean by each of the Rules:
##### Rule 1 - Designed for reusability
*Violation #1*
```
HTML:
<div class="div-section-1">text</p>
```
```
CSS:
.div-section-1 {
  background-color: red;
  border: 1px solid black;
  font: 12px arial, verdana;
  width: 150px;
  height: 500px;
  float: left;
}
```
Anywhere we reuse this class will have *all* of the following:
- background color of red
- 1px black border
- 12px arial font
- 150px width
- 500px height
- floated left

I have a hard time imagining we'll be able to reuse the class at all.

*Improvement #1*
To improve that class, we should divide it into reusable parts, where possible.

For example:
```
HTML:
<div class="block-section secondary-bg secondary-font" id="div-section-1">text</p>
```
```
CSS:
.block-section {
  border: 1px solid black;
  width: 150px;
}
.secondary-bg {
  background-color: red;
}
.secondary-font {
  font: 12px arial, verdana;
}
#div-section-1 {
  height: 500px;
  float: left;
}
```
Now we have 3 reuseable classes, and one unique ID.
*Rationale:*
.block-section
- Used on any blocks which require the same border and width
.secondary-font
- Used on any HTML elements which will use the site's secondary font face and size
.secondary-bg
- Used on any HTML elements which will use the site's secondary background color
- If the site's secondary bg color ever changes, only this class needs to be updated
#div-section-1
- Used only for positioning the block in question

There is no perfect answer for CSS granularity, but the benefits will become clearer the more you use it.

##### Rule 2 - Not overly restricted by its name
*Violation #1*
```
<p class="twelve-pixel-font">text</p>
```
This is a bad choice of name for the class because if you ever decide to change the font size from 12px to anything else, you cannot simply edit the class' properties. You will also have to rename the class for it to still make sense.

*Improvement #1*
```
<p class="medium-font">text</p>
```
This name is an improvement, because if the layout's 'medium' font size changes, we don't have to worry about renaming the class everywhere it appears.
*Violation #1*
```
<div class="red-bg">text</p>
```
Let's say the secondary background color on your site is red. It seems like 'red-bg' makes sense - right? Well, it makes sense now, but if we update the layout in the future and the secondary color changes from red to green - we're setting ourselves up for a sloppy transition.

*Improvement #2*
```
<div class="secondary-bg">text</p>
```
Simply naming the class 'secondary-bg' is a big improvement because we retain the power to update our layout's colors in the future without having to re-write both our HTML and CSS.

### Positioning Properties
#### Display
The display property specifies the type of box used for an HTML element.
Default value: Inline

- Display: inline
 - Displays an element as an inline element (like words in a sentence)
 - This is the default value for 'display'.
- Display: block
 - Makes an element behave like it is a block - similar to how a paragraph behaves.
- Display: inline-block
 - The *inside* of the element behaves like a block, and the *outside* of it is inline with surrounding elements.
- Display: none
 - The element is not displayed at all.
- Display: list-item
 - The element behaves as if it is an item in a list.
- Display: initial
 - Makes an element use the default value for display.
- Display: inherit
 - Makes an element inherit its parent's value for display.
- Complete list of Display options:
 - inline
 - block
 - flex
 - inline-block
 - inline-flex
 - inline-table
 - list-item
 - run-in
 - table
 - table-caption
 - table-column-group
 - table-header-group
 - table-footer-group
 - table-row-group
 - table-cell
 - table-column
 - table-row
 - none
 - initial
 - inherit
*For detailed information on these, take a look at http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp .*

#### Float
When an item is floated to the left or right, it moves as far to that side as it can.
- Float: Left
 - Element moves as far left as possible.
- Float: Right
 - Element moves as far right as possible.
- Float: None
 - Element displays normally (This is the default).
- Float: Initial
 - Value is default (none).
- Float: Inherit
 - Inherits this property from its parent.

#### Position
- Position: relative
 - The element is positioned relative to it's default position.
 - This allows you to adjust the default position (left:20; top:20).
- Position: absolute
 - Element becomes relative to the first non-static ancestor element.
- Position: fixed
 - Element is positioned relative to the browser window itself.
 - This is useful for pinning a menu to the top of a browser window.
- Position: static
 - Default value, element is positioned naturally in the document.
- Position: initial
 - Value is default (static).
- Position: inherit
 - Inherits this property from its parent.

### Spacing Properties
#### Margin
- Margin refers to spacing *outside* of an element.
 - Example: http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_margin_sides
 - Options:
   - margin-top: 2px;
    - margin-right: 2px;
    - margin-bottom: 2px;
    - margin-left: 2px;
#### Padding
- Padding refers to spacing *inside* of an element.
 - Example: http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_padding_sides
 - Options:
   - padding-top: 2px;
    - padding-right: 2px;
    - padding-bottom: 2px;
    - padding-left: 2px;

### Colors
#### Hex codes
Hex codes are 6 digit codes specifying which color the browser should render.

@tip: You can use the 'inspect' tool to see what the hex codes used on popular websites are.
##### Common hex codes
You should definitely know the hex codes for at least black and white by heart.
- Black: #000000
- White: #FFFFFF

## How do I use it with HTML?
1. Place all of your CSS into its own .css file.
 - For example, 'css/style.css' can contain only the example code above.
2. In-between the HTML file's <head></head> tags, place the following:
 - ```<link href="css/style.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet">```
 - Set the 'href' attribute as the relative path to the CSS file.
 - This makes the CSS in your file be used by your HTML page.
